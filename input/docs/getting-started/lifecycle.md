Title: Support lifecycle
Excerpt: Cake versioning and support lifecycle
---

# Versioning

Cake uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).
This means that 1.0.1 will only contain bugfixes compared to 1.0 and 1.1 will only contain backwards compatible features.
2.0 will contain breaking changes compared to 1.0.

# Support lifecycle

We support the current major release with bug fixes to the latest version.

Major releases will be supported until next major release has been released.
Once a newer major release has been published support for previous releases has ended.
This means that once 2.0 ships we no longer will release any fixes for 1.x.
