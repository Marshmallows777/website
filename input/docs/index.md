Cake (C# Make) is a cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL for tasks such as compiling code, copying files and folders, running unit tests, compressing files and building NuGet packages.

It ships both as a [.NET Tool](/docs/running-builds/runners/dotnet-core-tool) and  a [library for using in console applications](/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) and runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Out of the box it contains a number of different [aliases](/dsl) to allow you to quickly orchestrate your build process, such as MSBuild, DotNet Core CLI, NuGet, and Chocolatey.
In addition, there are over 300 community driven [addins](/extensions) and modules</a> which allow you to perform other build tasks.

Extensions which enhance usability while working with Cake builds are also available for [editors and IDE's](/docs/integrations/editors) as well as [build systems](/docs/integrations/build-systems).
